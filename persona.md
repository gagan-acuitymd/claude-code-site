# Target Persona: Product Marketing Manager

## Demographics

- **Title:** Product Marketing Manager or Senior PMM
- **Company stage:** Series B SaaS (50–200 employees)
- **Experience:** 3–5 years in product marketing
- **Reports to:** VP of Marketing or Head of Product Marketing

## Current AI usage

- Uses ChatGPT daily for drafting copy, summarizing research, and brainstorming positioning
- Comfortable with prompting but has never opened a terminal or written code
- Has heard of GitHub Copilot and Claude Code but assumes they're "for engineers"
- Skeptical that AI coding tools have any relevance to a marketing role

## Key objection

> "I'm not a developer — why would I need a coding tool?"

## What she cares about

| Priority | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Pipeline contribution** | Needs to show marketing-sourced and marketing-influenced pipeline every quarter |
| **Competitive intelligence** | Responsible for battlecards, win/loss analysis, and keeping sales armed against competitors |
| **Content velocity** | Under constant pressure to ship landing pages, one-pagers, and launch materials faster than the team can resource |

## Day-to-day frustrations

- Files Jira tickets for simple landing page changes and waits days for engineering
- Manually copies competitor pricing into spreadsheets every quarter
- Builds demo decks in slides when an interactive prototype would be far more persuasive
- Spends hours formatting data for board and QBR presentations

## What would change her mind

- Seeing a peer (not an engineer) build something real in minutes
- A clear before/after: "This used to take a sprint, now it takes 30 minutes"
- Low-risk entry point — she can try it on a side project without breaking anything
- Proof that the output is production-quality, not a toy

## Messaging angle

Don't sell her a coding tool. Sell her **speed and independence** — the ability to ship without waiting, prototype without asking, and analyze without formatting. Claude Code is the bridge between her ideas and live output.
